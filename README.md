# Emotion Detection from Text: ML vs Pre-trained Model Approaches

This repository compares two approaches for emotion detection from text:
1. **Machine Learning (ML) Approach**: Using classical ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning techniques like LSTM.
2. **Pre-trained Model (Transformer-based) Approach**: Using a fine-tuned pre-trained transformer model such as DistilRoBERTa for emotion classification.

## Overview

Emotion detection is the task of identifying and classifying the emotion expressed in a given text. The two main approaches used in this repository are:

1. **Machine Learning Approach**:
    - Involves training a model from scratch using labeled datasets.
    - The text is vectorized (e.g., using TF-IDF, Word2Vec) and fed into a classification algorithm like Logistic Regression, SVM, or LSTM.
    - Requires substantial preprocessing and feature engineering.
  
2. **Pre-trained Transformer Approach**:
    - Leverages pre-trained models like **DistilRoBERTa** (fine-tuned for emotion detection).
    - The model is already trained on a large corpus and has learned rich representations of text.
    - It simplifies the process by using pre-built pipelines for classification without the need for manual feature extraction.

## Comparison

| **Aspect**               | **Machine Learning (ML) Approach**                               | **Pre-trained Model (Transformer-based)**                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Preparation**      | Requires manual preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal) and feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec). | Minimal preprocessing required, uses the embeddings learned by the transformer. |
| **Training**              | Requires collecting and labeling a dataset, followed by training the model (Logistic Regression, SVM, or LSTM). | Fine-tunes a pre-trained model on your emotion detection task, minimal training needed. |
| **Model Complexity**      | Can be simple (Logistic Regression) or more complex (LSTM). Requires choosing the right algorithm and hyperparameters. | Highly complex, leveraging deep learning architectures like transformers. |
| **Performance**           | May underperform on complex tasks without large datasets and careful tuning. | Generally performs well even with smaller datasets due to pre-training. |
| **Interpretability**      | Easier to interpret with simpler models like Logistic Regression. LSTMs or deep learning models are harder to interpret. | Harder to interpret, though you can analyze attention weights or token importance for insights. |
| **Use Case**              | Works well when you have a custom dataset or require a lightweight solution. | Best for quick prototyping or when working with a standard emotion detection task. |
| **Deployment**            | Easier to deploy as lightweight models. May need optimizations for larger models. | Can be computationally expensive, but using pre-trained models like DistilRoBERTa can help reduce resource consumption. |
| **Flexibility**           | Very flexible: you can choose your model and modify it according to specific requirements. | Less flexible for custom tasks, but works well for general emotion detection tasks. |

## Approach 1: Machine Learning (ML) Approach

### 1.1 Preprocessing
   - **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, removal of stopwords, lemmatization, and stemming.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Use methods like **TF-IDF**, **Word2Vec**, or **GloVe** to convert text into numeric vectors.

### 1.2 Models
   - **Logistic Regression**: A simple classifier that works well with linearly separable data.
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: An algorithm that works well with high-dimensional data and finds the optimal hyperplane.
   - **Random Forest / XGBoost**: Tree-based models that can handle feature interactions well.
   - **LSTM (Deep Learning)**: Used when the context of the sequence is important.

### 1.3 Evaluation
   - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** are used to evaluate the model.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the prediction results and detect biases.

### 1.4 Example Implementation
   - Use of **Logistic Regression** with **TF-IDF** for emotion classification.
   - Example code provided in the repository.

## Approach 2: Pre-trained Transformer Model Approach

### 2.1 Model
   - **DistilRoBERTa**: A fine-tuned version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) trained on emotion-labeled text.
   - **Emotion Detection Pipeline**: Uses the Hugging Face `transformers` library, simplifying the process of text classification.

### 2.2 Steps
   1. Load a pre-trained transformer model (DistilRoBERTa).
   2. Fine-tune the model for emotion classification.
   3. Use the model to predict emotions directly from the text.

### 2.3 Evaluation
   - Similar to the ML approach, evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score** can be used.
   - The performance of the pre-trained model is generally high without needing substantial hyperparameter tuning.

### 2.4 Example Implementation
   - Implementation of the **emotion classification pipeline** using Hugging Face and **Streamlit** for the user interface.

## Installation and Setup

To use both approaches, clone this repository and follow the instructions below:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run ML Approach
```bash
python ml_model.py
```

### 3. Run Pre-trained Model Approach (Transformer)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Conclusion

- **Machine Learning Approach**: Ideal for custom models or specific tasks, but requires careful data preparation, feature extraction, and model tuning.
- **Pre-trained Model Approach**: Offers high performance with minimal effort, especially for standard tasks like emotion detection, and is great for rapid prototyping.

For most use cases, the **Pre-trained Transformer Model** offers a simpler, faster, and more accurate solution without the need for extensive data preparation or model training.

## Future Improvements
- **Fine-Tuning**: Experimenting with other pre-trained models like **BERT** or **RoBERTa** for better performance.
- **Custom Datasets**: Fine-tune on specific emotion datasets for more targeted results.
- **Explainability**: Implement techniques for better interpretability of the predictions (e.g., SHAP values for ML models, attention visualization for transformers).
